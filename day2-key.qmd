## Vectors

```{r}
# Create a vector
dogs <- c("teddy", "khora", "waffle", "banjo", "tallie")

#Check the class
class(dogs)

```

```{r}
cats <- c("creamsicle wolf", 14.2, 3L)
```

```{r}
years <- c(20, 40, 16, 2)
class(years)
typeof(years)

#if you wanted them to be an integer, you need to put an L
```

we can also ask question that are true or false

```{r}
# want to do a conditional check
# is. <<< asks questions "is this THIS"
# as. <<< gives a command "make this THIS"

is.numeric(years)
is.character(years)
```

```{r}
dog_food <- c(teddy = "purina", khora = "alpo", waffle = "fancy feast")

dog_food

dog_food[2]

dog_food["khora"]
```
